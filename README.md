# Exquisite Corpse
## Group Repository

This repository allows you to combine your group's trinkets into a single Canvas. 
You will present this Canvas to the class during the two presentations.

> [!NOTE]
> To make the animation continuous, allow trinkets to load on their own (do not click "Run" on the Canvas).

### Instructions

To add your trinket to the Canvas, follow these steps:

1. Copy your trinket link by clicking on the "Share" button, choosing link and copying the link.

2. Exit [`index.html`](index.html). In lines 34-37, you'll see variables containing the starter code trinket links. Replace the value of the varaible corresponding to your quadrant with your trinket link.  

3. Commit your changes. 

4. If a group member hasn't already done so, deploy your code to GitHub Pages:
    - Choose 'Settings' from the top menu of this repo.
    - From 'Settings', choose 'Pages' from the left menu.
    - Under "Source", select "main" branch.
    - Wait a few minutes for the site to build, then refresh the page to see your link. 

5. Find the link to your GitHub pages site from this repo by navigiating Settings->Pages. The link will take you to your group's Canvas.
