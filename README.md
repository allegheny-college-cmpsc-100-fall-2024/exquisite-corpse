# Exquisite Corpse
## Group Repository

This repository allows you to combine your group's trinkets into a single Canvas. 
You will present this Canvas to the class during the two presentations. 

### Instructions

To add your trinket to the Canvas, follow these steps:

1. Copy your trinket link by clicking on the "Share" button, choosing link and copying the link.
2. Exit [`index.html`](index.html). In lines 33-36, you'll see variables containing the starter code trinket links. Replace the value of the varaible corresponding to your quadrant with your trinket link.  
3. Commit your changes. 
4. If a group member hasn't already done so, deploy your code to GitHub Pages:
    - Click [this link](settings/pages) to access the GitHub Pages settings.
    - Under "Source", select "main" branch.
    - Wait a few minutes for the site to build, then refresh the page. 
5. Find the link to your GitHub pages site [here](settings/pages) (it should look something like the screenshot below). This link will take you to your group's Canvas.
